# ControlPlaneProvider for CACPPT (Cluster API Control Plane Provider Talos).
# Managed here rather than by the capi-operator Helm chart because ArgoCD
# treats the chart's sync-wave annotated resources as hooks, which can be
# pruned and not recreated during self-heal. Declaring it as a regular
# resource ensures it persists.
